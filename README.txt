This is a repository of USP related digital stuff, including logos, business cards, and flyers. This include both current (at the time of writing) and legacy stuff. I have also tried to document both the images/documents and online artifacts (e.g. websites, social media). I hope that this will prevent more stuff from being lost and forgotten.

This includes both PNGs and working documents such as SVGs and XCFs. .svg files were created using inkscape, and the .xcf files were made using GIMP.
